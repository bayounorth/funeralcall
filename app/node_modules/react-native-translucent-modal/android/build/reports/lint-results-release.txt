D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-translucent-modal\android\src\main\java\com\mf\translucentmodal\TranslucentModalHostHelper.java:45: Error: Expected resource of type styleable [ResourceType]
    TypedArray ta = theme.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs);
                                                 ~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ResourceType":
   Ensures that resource id's passed to APIs are of the right type; for
   example, calling Resources.getColor(R.string.name) is wrong.

D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-translucent-modal\android\src\main\java\com\mf\translucentmodal\TranslucentModalHostHelper.java:51: Warning: Using internal inset dimension resource status_bar_height is not supported [InternalInsetResource]
    int statusBarId = resources.getIdentifier("status_bar_height", "dimen", "android");
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "InternalInsetResource":
   The internal inset dimension resources are not a supported way to retrieve
   the relevant insets for your application. The insets are dynamic values
   that can change while your app is visible, and your app's window may not
   intersect with the system UI. To get the relevant value for your app and
   listen to updates, use androidx.core.view.WindowInsetsCompat and related
   APIs.

D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-translucent-modal\android\build.gradle:5: Warning: A newer version of compileSdkVersion than 28 is available: 34 [GradleDependency]
    compileSdkVersion 28
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-translucent-modal\android\build.gradle:34: Warning: Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds (com.facebook.react:react-native:+) [GradleDynamicVersion]
    implementation 'com.facebook.react:react-native:+'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDynamicVersion":
   Using + in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available
   version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not
   recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a
   slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a
   dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using
   it in the minor version position.)

D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-translucent-modal\android\src\main\java\com\mf\translucentmodal\TranslucentModalHostView.java:57: Warning: This method should only be accessed from tests or within private scope [VisibleForTests]
        Dialog dialog = getDialog();
                        ~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "VisibleForTests":
   This check looks for accesses from production code (e.g. not tests) where
   the access would not have been allowed with the intended production
   visibility.

   Depending on your development environment, you may be able to use an
   @VisibleForTesting annotation to specify the intended visibility if the
   method had not been more widely visible for the tests.

   When using androidx.annotations.VisibleForTesting, the production
   visibility is assumed to be private unless specified with the otherwise=
   parameter. com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting and
   com.android.internal.annotations.VisibleForTesting work similarly with
   their own parameters called productionVisibility and visibility.

   If instead you use org.jetbrains.annotations.VisibleForTesting, there is no
   such parameter, and the production visibility is instead assumed to be "one
   step down" from the testing visibility. For example, if the testing
   visibility is public, the production visibility is assumed to be
   package-private.

D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-translucent-modal\android\build.gradle:11: Error: Google Play requires that apps target API level 33 or higher. [ExpiredTargetSdkVersion]
        targetSdkVersion 28
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ExpiredTargetSdkVersion":
   Configuring your app to target a recent API level ensures that users
   benefit from significant security and performance improvements, while still
   allowing your app to run on older Android versions (down to the
   minSdkVersion).

   To update your targetSdkVersion, follow the steps from "Meeting Google Play
   requirements for target API level",
