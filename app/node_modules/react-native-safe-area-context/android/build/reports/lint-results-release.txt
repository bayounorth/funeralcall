D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-safe-area-context\android\build.gradle:15: Warning: A newer version of com.android.tools.build:gradle than 4.1.2 is available: 8.13.1. (There is also a newer version of 4.1.𝑥 available, if upgrading to 8.13.1 is difficult: 4.1.3) [AndroidGradlePluginVersion]

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

D:\wamp\www\FUNERALCALL\app\node_modules\react-native-safe-area-context\android\src\main\java\com\th3rdwave\safeareacontext\SafeAreaUtils.java:14: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 24 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.
